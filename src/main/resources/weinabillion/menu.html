            <p>â€œWith so many trees in the city, you could see the spring coming each day until a night of warm wind
                would bring it suddenly in one morning. Sometimes the heavy cold rains would beat it back so that it
                would seem that it would never come and that you were losing a season out of your life. This was the
                only truly sad time in Paris because it was unnatural. You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you
                died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the
                cold, wintry light."</p>

            <p>"On under the heavy trees of the small town that are a part of your heart if it is your town and you have
                walked under them, but that are only too heavy, that shut out the sun and dampen the houses for a
                stranger; out past the last house and on to the highway that rose and fell straight away ahead with
                banks of red dirt sliced cleanly away and the second growth timber on both sides. It was not his country
                but it was the middle of fall and all of this country was good to drive through and to see. "</p>
